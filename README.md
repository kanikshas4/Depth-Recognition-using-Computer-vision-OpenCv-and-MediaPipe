# Depth-Recognition-using-Computer-vision-OpenCv-and-MediaPipe
In this project I have computed the distance of the computer user face from the screen. For this I have used MediaPipe google's computer vision Ml library.
and OpenCv. The distance is computed between the eyes of the user to the computer screen mounted web camera.
