# Depth-Recognition-using-Computer-vision-OpenCv-and-MediaPipe
In this project I have computed the distance of the computer user face from the screen. For this I have used MediaPipe google's computer vision Ml library.
and OpenCv. The distance is computed between the eyes of the user to the computer screen mounted web camera.
It is recommended that the minimum distance from the screen must be 51cm. so I have created a condition which says that if the distance from the screen is less than 51 cm then an alert will be raised. This project is a part of my research project which is to detect all the factors causing computer vision syndrome.
